1. I use Joi to validate the data that enters the API
2. I use the models to validate the data related with the db

DB Schema:
1. The library Model has all of the methods to execute queries, but when I extend it, I can
modify those methods



To review:
1. The way JS import libraries because apparently the following is pretty different:
  const {setupModels}  = require("./../db/models/index");
  const setupModels  = require("./../db/models/index");
