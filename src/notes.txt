1. I use Joi to validate the data that enters the API
2. I use the models to validate the data related with the db

DB Schema:
1. The library Model has all of the methods to execute queries, but when I extend it, I can
modify those methods. Likewise I won't use it because I'm gonna use the ORM to implement the migrations
but not to implement queries


To review:
1. The way JS import libraries because apparently the following is pretty different:
  const {setupModels}  = require("./../db/models/index");
  const setupModels  = require("./../db/models/index");



module.exports = {
  //The tool that helps us with the migrations needs its own config file
  'config': './db/config.js',
  'models-path':'./db/models/',
  'migrations-path':'./db/migrations/',
  'seeders-path':'./db/seeders/'
}
